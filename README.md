# Hi, I'm Jaen üöÄ

_Computer Systems Engineering Student at [Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Acapulco](https://acapulco.tecnm.mx)_ üíª  
_Passionate about technology, software development, Linux, cloud computing, web and mobile applications, cybersecurity, and DevOps._  

I focus on **backend development with Python** and **web technologies like Astro and Svelte**, but I also enjoy exploring mobile app development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. My goal is to build scalable and impactful solutions while continuously learning and growing as a developer.
